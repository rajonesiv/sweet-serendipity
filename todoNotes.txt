/*
 * Notes for Todo-Show
 * TODO: No problem, but additional code needs to be written, usually when
 *    you are skipping something. Something that needs to be done. This could
 *    be a feature to be added later, or indicating that something is a stub
 *    and needs to be implemented.
 * FIXME: This works, sort of, but it could be done better.
 *     (usually code written in a hurry that needs rewriting). A subclass of
 *     the TODO tag, indicating something is broken that needs to be fixed.
 * UNDONE: A note to indicate a change which was a rollback or reversal of some
 *     other change. This comment will usually indicate what was removed and why
 * CHANGED,
 * XXX: Warning about possible pitfalls, can be used as NOTE:XXX:.
 * IDEA,
 * HACK: Not very well written or malformed code to circumvent a problem/bug.
 *      Should be used as  HACK:FIXME:.
 * NOTE: Description of how the code works (when it isn't self evident).
 * REVIEW, NB,
 * BUG: There is a problem here. Known bug that should be fixed
 * QUESTION,
 * COMBAK, TEMP, DEBUG, OPTIMIZE, and WARNING
