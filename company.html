    <h2>Sweet Serendipity Owners</h2>
    <p>Sweet Serendipity is the fulfillment of a vision of its developers, all
      life-long Indianapolis residents. We feature nearly 40 hand-dipped
      flavors, homemade waffle cones, malts, shakes, sundaes. The menu also
      includes locally-roasted fair-trade coffees, teas and hot chocolate with
      a focus on environmentally sustainable practices.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re open year-round! You can cool off in the summer with any tasty
      treat, or warm up with a coffee or tea next to our cozy fireplace in the
      winter.</p>
    <p>Sweet Serendipity is located in several locations through Indiana.
      Sweet Serendipity features 21st century conveniences, including Wi-Fi, a
      water station for filling water bottles, and outdoor seating to take in
      the outdoor beauty surrounding each of our stores.  We look forward to
      seeing you soon!</p>
    <h2>Our Environmentally Friendly Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We humbly offer you to stay a while with your ice cream in our glassware.
       If you're on the go, we have compostable cups & spoons! We recycle as
       much as we can and hope that you do too! We are striving to become a
       certified 'green business'!</p>
